          <p class="article-desc">
            Modern wind turbines are one of the pillars of the green transformation. They generate energy without
            emissions and shape the landscape of the future. Wind power is currently one of the fastest-growing
            renewable energy sources worldwide. Thanks to advances in turbine technology and energy storage,
            wind farms can supply entire regions with stable, clean power. Additionally, offshore wind projects
            are expanding rapidly, reducing the visual and noise impact on residential areas. Wind energy helps
            decarbonize the economy, supports energy independence, and is crucial in the global effort to combat
            climate change.

          <p class="article-desc">
            Rooftop vegetation not only beautifies the city â€“ it acts as a natural air filter, supports biodiversity
            and reduces the heat island effect. Green roofs provide ecological, aesthetic, and thermal benefits.
            They lower building energy consumption by acting as insulation, improve stormwater management by absorbing
            rainfall, and promote urban biodiversity by creating habitats for pollinators and birds. In addition, they
            contribute to improved air quality and noise reduction. As cities continue to densify, green roofs offer an
            innovative way to bring nature back into urban life and make metropolises more resilient to climate change.

          <p class="article-desc">
            Photovoltaic panels transform sunlight into clean energy. They are a symbol of self-sufficient, smart
            cities of the future. Solar panels are becoming more accessible, efficient, and integrated into modern
            architecture. Beyond residential rooftops, they are now found on facades, carports, and even roads.
            With the rise of smart grids and energy storage systems, solar energy allows users to produce, store, and
            manage their own electricity. This decentralization strengthens energy security and reduces reliance on
            fossil fuels. Solar technologies are also key in rural electrification and are vital in developing
            sustainable.
